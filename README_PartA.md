# DL_Assignment_2
## 1. Libraries Used
- Wandb: Used for experiment tracking and visualization.
- PyTorch: Deep learning framework for building and training the CNN model.
- torchvision: Provides datasets, models, and transformations for computer vision tasks.
- scikit-learn: Used for splitting the dataset into training and validation sets.
- matplotlib: Library for creating plots and visualizations.
- PIL: Python Imaging Library, used for image processing.
- numpy: Library for numerical computing.

## 2. CNN Model Explanation
The CNN model used in this assignment consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers. Batch normalization and dropout are applied for regularization. The architecture can be customized by adjusting parameters such as the number of filters, kernel size, activation function, etc.
